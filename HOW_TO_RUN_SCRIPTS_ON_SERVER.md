# How to Run Shell Scripts on Your DigitalOcean Server

## Method 1: Upload and Run Script (Recommended)

### Step 1: Connect to Your Server
```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```
Replace `your-server-ip` with your actual DigitalOcean droplet IP address.

### Step 2: Upload the Script File
You have several options to upload the script:

#### Option A: Using SCP (from your local machine)
```bash
# From your local machine (where the script is located)
scp deploy-scripts/server-setup.sh root@your-server-ip:/root/
```

#### Option B: Using nano to create the script directly on server
```bash
# On your server, create the script file
nano /root/server-setup.sh

# Copy and paste the entire content from deploy-scripts/server-setup.sh
# Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save
```

#### Option C: Using wget (if script is hosted online)
```bash
# If you upload the script to GitHub or another hosting service
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/server-setup.sh -O /root/server-setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable
```bash
chmod +x /root/server-setup.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
```bash
/root/server-setup.sh
```

Or simply:
```bash
bash /root/server-setup.sh
```

## Method 2: Copy-Paste Commands (Alternative)

If you prefer not to upload the script file, you can copy and paste the commands directly:

### Step 1: Connect to Your Server
```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

### Step 2: Run Commands One by One
Copy each section from the script and paste it into your terminal:

```bash
# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js 18
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install nginx
apt install nginx -y
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx

# Continue with other commands...
```

## Method 3: Using Screen (For Long-Running Scripts)

If the script takes a long time to run, use screen to prevent disconnection:

### Step 1: Install and Start Screen
```bash
apt install screen -y
screen -S deployment
```

### Step 2: Run the Script
```bash
chmod +x /root/server-setup.sh
/root/server-setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Detach from Screen (Optional)
Press `Ctrl+A` then `D` to detach from screen session.

### Step 4: Reattach to Screen (If Needed)
```bash
screen -r deployment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Error
```bash
# If you get permission denied, make sure the script is executable
chmod +x /root/server-setup.sh
```

### Script Not Found
```bash
# Check if the script exists
ls -la /root/server-setup.sh

# If not found, re-upload or recreate the script
```

### Command Not Found
```bash
# If bash command is not found, try with sh
sh /root/server-setup.sh
```

## What the Script Does

The `server-setup.sh` script will automatically:
1. âœ… Update your system packages
2. âœ… Install Node.js 18
3. âœ… Install and configure nginx
4. âœ… Install Git and PM2
5. âœ… Set up firewall (UFW)
6. âœ… Install security tools (fail2ban)
7. âœ… Create nginx configuration for ServerCanine
8. âœ… Create backup and deployment scripts
9. âœ… Set up proper permissions

## After Running the Script

Once the script completes successfully, you'll see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ Server setup completed successfully!

Next steps:
1. Upload your ServerCanine project files to /var/www/servercanine
2. Edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/servercanine and replace 'your-domain.com' with your actual domain
3. Run: cd /var/www/servercanine && npm install && npm run build
4. Run: systemctl restart nginx
5. Configure your Cloudflare DNS settings
```

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh root@your-server-ip

# Upload script (from local machine)
scp deploy-scripts/server-setup.sh root@your-server-ip:/root/

# Make executable and run (on server)
chmod +x /root/server-setup.sh && /root/server-setup.sh

# Check if nginx is running
systemctl status nginx

# View script output/logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

That's it! Your server will be ready for ServerCanine deployment after running the script.
